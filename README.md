Introduction
============
This repository contains documents and artifacts related to the peer-graded assignment "Getting and Cleaning data."

About the script
================

Script Name: run_analysis.R

Note: The script assumes extraction of the source files from the provided zip file to a working directory (based on analysis with R, version 3.3.1 (2016-06-21)).

The script carries out the following activities:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set named TidyDataset.txt with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

About the Code Book
-------------------
The CodeBook.md file explains the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.
